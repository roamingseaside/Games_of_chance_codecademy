Questions:

1.  For a roulette function.  Is there a way to have the user choose what bet they are going to make?
  a.  i.e., even or odd, but also choose a specific number
2.  For the pick a card gaame:  
  a. add functionality to pick again if there is a tie (and double the bet...similar to the Vegas game 'war').
  b. suspect this would be done with a list, but how do you replecate for a deck of 52 cards versus what is currently being done with 2-14.
3.  The check money and check bet amount code lines are repeated for each game.
  a. Is there a way to make this an inner function and then have the function terminate the outer function as well?
  b. my early attempts would output someehting like "you cant do that" but still run the bet function
